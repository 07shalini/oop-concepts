# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

This repository contains Java examples that demonstrate the four core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

### 🔐 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which helps in data hiding and protection from unauthorized access.

### 🧬 2. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (parent). It promotes code reusability and establishes a parent-child relationship between classes.

### 🎭 3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows one task to be performed in different ways. In Java, it can be achieved through **method overloading** (compile-time) and **method overriding** (runtime), helping make code more flexible and extensible.

### 🧩 4. Abstraction
Abstraction focuses on hiding the internal implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces in Java.
